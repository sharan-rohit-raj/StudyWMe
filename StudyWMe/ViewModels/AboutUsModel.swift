    @Published var aboutUs: String = "The 21st century has changed the stationary aids of the modern students and evolved in efficient ways to conduct their school life. From being luxury, mobiles and laptops have turned out to be essentials as the study methods changed over the past couple of decades. Students themselves prefer to read, write and save in digital notebooks rather than physical notebooks as they are convenient to store, retrieve and refer to their keynotes. While writing has significantly advanced, the same cannot be said for the study part of the education. Thus studying students and those who prepare for other competitive exams, need a technology application that can make their learning, understanding and remembering easier and quicker.\n\n  The project aims to bring the two most popular ways of studying in the app form i-e., flashcards and self-evaluating quizzes via digital platform. This will help students practice hundreds of questions using flashcards and self-evaluating quizzes within a device at their fingertip. This app aims to eliminate the need to carry a bulkload of physical flashcards and self-evaluating quiz sheets with them. Students will no longer have to limit themselves to carrying only a specific amount of study materials to school with the fear of losing or physically damaging or forgetting them."
